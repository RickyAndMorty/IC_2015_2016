AI techniques can help to improve the configuration and operation of network devices, optical performance monitoring, modulation format recognition, fiber nonlinearities mitigation and quality of transmission (QoT) estimation. 

AI presents several opportunities for automating operations and introducing intelligent decision making in network planning and in dynamic control and management of network resources, including issues like connection establishment, self-configuration and self-optimization, through prediction and estimation by utilizing present network state and historical data. Search algorithms and optimization theory have been widely used for optical network planning and dimensioning, usualy complemented or extended with local search algorithms and metaheuristics like simulated annealing, swarm optimization and genetic algorithms.  Optical network planning involves tasks like designing the physical topology of the network and ensuring survivability while minimizing costs. 


This work uses the Particle Swarm Optmizatio (PSO) algorithm to improve the Quality of Transmission in a Passive Optical Network.
