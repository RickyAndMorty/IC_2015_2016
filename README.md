Ai techniques can help to improve the configuration and operation of network devices, optical performance monitoring, modulation format recognition, fiber nonlinearities mitigation and quality of transmission (QoT) estimation. 

This work uses the Particle Swarm Optmizatio (PSO) algorithm to improve the Quality of Transmission in a Passive Optical Network.
